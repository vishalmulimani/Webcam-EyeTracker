The folder contains the following codes, 
1) Training.py: This is the code that is run for the first time to train the device. It records the gaze points and produces 'training_granted.tsv' file which has the data of gaze points. 
2) Testing.py: After running 'Training.py', this execute this code. Datasets are stored in 'test_granted.tsv'. 
3) Security.py: This is the heart of the program, where the actual secutiy is implementated. This codes takes the datasets produced by the training phase and testing phase. Little math is involved in it and it says that weather the access has to be given to the user or not. If the datasets match 50% of each other, then access is given. We have given 50% because we are using web-cam. If the user is recommended to use Eye-Tracker device then the treshold has to be given more than 80%. 

The folder also contains pygazetracker directory, which has the header file which we directly cloned from github.
